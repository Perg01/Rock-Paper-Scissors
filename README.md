Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer and compete to win a total of 5 rounds.

Gameplay
To play the game:

- Begin Game: Press one of the three buttons representing rock, paper, or scissors to start the game.
- Round Outcome: The computer randomly selects its move, and the winner of each round is determined based on the traditional game rules (rock - beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper).
- Game Progress: Track the score as the game progresses. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.

Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS: Used for the structure and styling of the game interface.
- JavaScript: Implemented game logic and functionality for user interactions.

Additional Features

- End-of-Round Images: Images displayed at the end of each round were generated from Textpro.me to add visual interest and engagement to the game.
- Responsive Design: The game interface is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
